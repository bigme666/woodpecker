# woodpecker

This simple VB script sends the {NUMLOCK}{NUMLOCK} keyboard code with a random interval of time regulated by the min and max parameters (expressed in milliseconds).
To stop the script is sufficient to delete the text file Woodpecker_ON.txt that the script itself creates in the C:/TEMP folder.

While testing, use the provided kill.vbs script to kill all vbs scripts without having to delete the Woodpecker_ON.txt file.


Be careful because the use of this script might break your Corporation security policies.
